# Hints for device selection

A device can only be selected if:

- it is a component of another device (e.g., a mass flow controller in a test stand; no stand-alone devices can be assigned to a data column)
- it is the component of the device (e.g., test stand) to which you are adding data,
- the device in question can record data,
- the combination of fundamental units must be the same for both the device and the data column (e.g., if the device records kg/hr, then the data column must also have units of mass/time, e.g., kg/hr or kg/s), and
- The timeframe of the data and the timeframe that the device is installed in the test stand must overlap precisely, down to the second.
