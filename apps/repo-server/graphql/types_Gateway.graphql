Represents the current user that is actively using the app. There is only a single `CurrentUser`
(which exists even if no user is logged in), so the `id` field has a single known value. This known
`id` value is essential for updating the UI. The actual information about the logged in user
(if applicable) is embedded in the `payload` field. Wrapping the `User` in this way allows relay to
keep track of the login state.
