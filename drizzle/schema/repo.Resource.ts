	 *
	 * Resources can be transformed into other resources, resulting in a parent-child relationship
	 * between the two. Taking into account that transformed resources can again be transformed,
	 * resources represent a tree structure with the root resource corresponding to the original,
	 * unmodified data as it was imported by the user.
	 *
	 * It is strongly recommended to import only data that has not been manually altered and instead
	 * perform any required transformations within adacta.
	 *
	 * A strong benefit of describing resources and their transformations in a tree structure is that
	 * this allows to trace back to the origin of the resource or data. Furthermore, this approach
	 * allows us to easily extend the program to be able to deal with other data formats.
